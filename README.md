With starter code, in the index.html and app.js files inside of this directory. The success of your code will be determined by whether it passes tests that are in the tests.js file. You do not need to do anything with tests.js, though you should take a look at it to see how it works.

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into master on GitHub (and then pull back into master on your laptop!) when the problem is completed. Do the problems in order. Don’t forget to pull the updated master branch from GitHub into your local master branch each time you merge a pull request, then make a new branch from master for the next problem.
Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function. Everything should be run by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.
